Create an interface for dividing the texture scaling factor by a factor from 1 to 10. This corresponds to magnify the texture by a factor of 1 to 10. 
Make sure your webpage interface supports changing:
- texturing on/off (when using the base colour shader too)
- texture address mode
- texture filtering mode
- texture scaling factor
- pixel subdivision level
- gamma (for gamma correction)


Inspect the default scene using different settings and describe how texture aliasing is affected by pixel
subdivision level and nearest versus linear filtering. The former is most easily explored using the base
colour shader. The latter is most easily explored using a magnified texture

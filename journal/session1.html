    <h1>Session 1 — Ray Casting</h1>
    <p>This session introduces the core ideas behind a simple ray tracer. We learn how to send rays from the camera, detect the first object they touch, and shade the result with a basic light model.</p>

      <h2>Exercise 1 — Pinhole Camera and Ray Directions</h2>
      <p>
        We created an HTML page with a canvas of size 512 by 512. The page loads WebGPU and clears the canvas to black.  
        We drew a rectangle that fills the canvas. In the fragment shader we built a tiny pinhole camera. For each pixel we computed the direction of the primary ray that goes from the eye through the image plane.  
        To test the directions we wrote the ray direction into the pixel color. Red grows from left to right. Green grows from bottom to top. Blue stays dark which gives a dark blue tone in the image.

    <!-- Exercise 2 -->
    <section class="exercise" id="ex2">
      <h2>Exercise 2 — Uniforms and Correct Aspect Ratio</h2>
      <p>
        We added a uniform block to pass the canvas aspect ratio and a camera constant that controls the zoom.  
        With MV.js we computed the camera basis in JavaScript. We uploaded the eye position and the three basis vectors of the image plane as uniforms.  
        We changed the canvas size to confirm that the image does not look stretched. The aspect ratio now keeps the geometry correct for any resolution.

    <section class="exercise" id="ex3">
      <h2>Exercise 3 — Intersections with Plane Triangle and Sphere</h2>
      <p>
        We created a HitInfo structure to store information about the closest hit.  
        We implemented three intersection functions. One for a plane. One for a triangle. One for a sphere.  
        In the shader we traced a ray and asked each object for an intersection. When we found a hit we updated the maximum distance so we always kept the nearest surface.  
        If the ray hit something we painted the pixel with the object color. If the ray missed we used a light blue background.

    <!-- Exercise 4 -->
    <section class="exercise" id="ex4">
      <h2>Exercise 4 — Diffuse Shading with a Point Light</h2>
      <p>
        We added a Light structure to return the incoming radiance and the direction to a point light.  
        In the shade function we used the inverse square law to compute how light fades with distance. We used the Lambert cosine law to compute how much light a surface receives depending on the angle between the light and the normal.  
        We stored the outgoing radiance in the pixel so we now see a shaded scene with simple diffuse materials.

    <!-- Exercise 5 -->
    <section class="exercise" id="ex5">
      <h2>Exercise 5 — Zoom Control and Live Re-render</h2>
      <p>
        We added a user interface to change the camera constant. There is a slider and the mouse wheel also works.  
        When the value changes we write the new uniform values and render again. This lets us explore the scene with different fields of view.  
        The optional gamma control can be added in the same way if needed.

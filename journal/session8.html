      <h1>Session 8 — Fresnel Reflection & Absorption</h1>
      <p>
        In this session we extend the ray tracer to support physically based transparent materials.
        We model angle-dependent reflectance using Fresnel equations and simulate light absorption
        inside transparent media using exponential attenuation.

      <h2>Exercise 1 — Fresnel-based transparency</h2>

      <p>
        Starting from the Cornell box scene with a mirror sphere and a glass sphere,
        I replaced the simple refraction-only shader with a physically based
        <b>transparent material</b> shader.
      </p>

      <p>
        I implemented a <code>fresnel_R</code> function based on Fresnel equations to compute
        the reflectance <b>R</b> as a function of the incident angle.
        Total internal reflection is handled by forcing <b>R = 1</b>.
      </p>

      <p>
        The Fresnel reflectance is used as a probability in a <b>Russian roulette</b>
        to choose between reflection and refraction at each hit.
        Indirect illumination is disabled at this stage to isolate the Fresnel effect.

      <h2>Exercise 2 — Indirect illumination and caustics</h2>

      <p>
        In this step, I enabled <b>indirect illumination</b> by allowing secondary ray bounces,
        while disabling the environment light to focus on light transport inside the scene.
      </p>

      <p>
        To correctly render caustics, I set the <b>emit flag</b> to true for specular materials
        (mirror and transparent).
        This allows light paths to contribute radiance even though direct lighting
        is not explicitly evaluated in these shaders.
      </p>

      <p>
        As a result, light focusing effects caused by reflection and refraction
        become visible on nearby surfaces.

      <h2>Exercise 3 — Absorption in transparent media</h2>

      <p>
        Finally, I added <b>absorption</b> inside transparent objects using
        <b>Bouguer’s law of exponential attenuation</b>.
        A non-zero RGB extinction coefficient is assigned when the glass sphere is hit.
      </p>

      <p>
        When a ray travels inside the transparent medium, the beam transmittance
        <code>Tr = exp(-σt · s)</code> is computed based on the traveled distance.
        Russian roulette is used to decide whether the ray is absorbed or transmitted.
      </p>

      <p>
        The path throughput is updated using the RGB transmittance, which gives the glass
        sphere a colored appearance that depends on the traveled distance.

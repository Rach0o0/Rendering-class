    <h1>Session 2 — Ray Tracing</h1>
    <p>
      In this session we extended our ray casting program into a real ray tracer.  
      We added shadows, reflections, refractions, and more advanced surface models like Phong and glossy shading.  
      This made the scene much more realistic and dynamic.

    <section class="exercise" id="w2-ex1">
      <h2>Exercise 1 — Hard shadows</h2>

      <p>
        In this exercise, I extended the ray tracer to support <b>hard shadows</b>.
        A <b>shadow ray</b> is generated from the surface hit point toward the point light.
      </p>

      <p>
        If the shadow ray intersects another object before reaching the light,
        the surface is considered to be in shadow and only the <b>ambient component</b>
        is returned. Otherwise, diffuse illumination is computed using
        <b>Lambert’s cosine law</b> and <b>inverse square falloff</b>.
      </p>

      <p>
        To support this, the <code>Light</code> struct was extended to include the
        distance to the light source, and a single <code>shade</code> function was used
        for all materials.

      <h2>Exercise 2 — Mirror reflection</h2>

      <p>
        This exercise adds a <b>mirror reflection shader</b>.
        When a ray hits a mirror surface, a new ray is generated in the reflected direction
        and traced recursively.
      </p>

      <p>
        A ray tracing loop was introduced, allowing rays to continue bouncing
        as long as the shader requests it through a flag stored in the <code>HitInfo</code> struct.
        The sphere in the default scene is rendered as a perfect mirror.
      </p>

      <p>
        An HTML selection menu was added to switch between different shaders at runtime,
        including a base color shader for debugging.

    <section class="exercise" id="w2-ex3">
      <h2>Exercise 3 — Refraction</h2>

      <p>
        In this exercise, <b>refraction</b> was implemented to simulate a glass material.
        The sphere is rendered as a refractive object with an index of refraction
        <b>n = 1.5</b>.
      </p>

      <p>
        The shader determines whether a ray enters or exits the object by checking
        the sign of the dot product between the ray direction and the surface normal.
        The relative index of refraction is stored in the <code>HitInfo</code> struct.
      </p>

      <p>
        Snell’s law is used to compute the refracted ray direction,
        and total internal reflection is handled when refraction is not possible.

    <!-- Exercise 4 -->
    <section class="exercise" id="w2-ex4">
      <h2>Exercise 4 — Phong illumination</h2>

      <p>
        This exercise introduces the <b>Phong illumination model</b>
        to simulate glossy specular highlights.
      </p>

      <p>
        A new shader option was added that computes both diffuse and specular reflection.
        The sphere uses a specular reflectance
        <b>ρ<sub>s</sub> = (0.1, 0.1, 0.1)</b> and a shininess exponent <b>s = 42</b>.
      </p>

      <p>
        The reflected light from the point light is approximated using the half-vector
        formulation of the Phong model, allowing visible highlights even though
        the light source has no physical size.

    <section class="exercise" id="w2-ex5">
      <h2>Exercise 5 — Glossy material</h2>

      <p>
        The final exercise combines <b>Phong illumination</b> with <b>refraction</b>
        to create a glossy glass material.
      </p>

      <p>
        The glossy shader blends specular highlights with refracted rays,
        producing a more realistic appearance.
        All scene description data (objects, materials, shaders)
        is handled inside a single <code>intersect_scene</code> function.
      </p>

      <p>
        This ensures that the intersection and shading functions remain generic
        and reusable for different scenes and materials.

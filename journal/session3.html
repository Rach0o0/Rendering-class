    <h1>Session 3 — Texture Mapping</h1>
    <p>
      In this session we make surfaces look more realistic by adding texture detail. 
      We load an image on the GPU, compute texture coordinates on geometry, look up colors from the texture, and use anti aliasing to reduce artifacts.

      <h2>Exercise 1 — Texture loading and sampling</h2>

      <p>
        In this exercise, I added support for loading an image file as a GPU texture
        without color space conversion.
        The texture is rendered directly using image plane (uv) coordinates.
      </p>

      <p>
        I implemented different texture addressing modes (<b>clamp-to-edge</b> and <b>repeat</b>)
        and filtering modes (<b>nearest</b> and <b>linear</b>), and added a simple interface
        to switch between them at runtime.

      <h2>Exercise 2 — Texture mapping on the plane</h2>

      <p>
        In this exercise, I mapped the loaded texture onto the plane of the default scene.
        Texture lookup was moved to the intersection stage by extending the <code>HitInfo</code>
        structure with texture coordinates.
      </p>

      <p>
        Texture coordinates are computed using inverse mapping based on an orthonormal
        basis (tangent, binormal, normal) of the plane.
        A texture scaling factor is applied, and an interface allows texturing to be
        enabled or disabled.

      <h2>Exercise 3 — Stratified jitter sampling</h2>

      <p>
        This exercise adds stratified jitter sampling for anti-aliasing.
        Each pixel is subdivided into multiple sub-pixels, and a ray is cast
        through each jittered sample position.
      </p>

      <p>
        Jitter offsets are computed in JavaScript and stored in a GPU storage buffer.
        The fragment shader accumulates the radiance from all sub-pixels and averages
        the result.
        An interface allows changing the pixel subdivision level interactively.

      <h2>Exercise 4 — Texture scaling and aliasing</h2>

      <p>
        In the final exercise, I extended the interface to control the texture
        scaling factor, allowing the texture to be magnified by a factor from 1 to 10.
      </p>

      <p>
        The interface now supports toggling texturing, texture address mode,
        filtering mode, pixel subdivision level, and gamma correction.
        Different configurations were used to observe texture aliasing effects
        and the impact of filtering and anti-aliasing.

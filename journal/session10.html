    <h1>Session 10 — Production Rendering with Blender</h1>
    <p>
      In this session, I use Blender and the Cycles renderer to place synthetic objects into a real photographed environment.
      The goal is to connect the rendering techniques studied in the course with a production-ready path tracer,
      using HDR environment lighting, realistic materials, and shadow catching.

    <section class="exercise">
      <h2>Scene setup — HDR environment and shadow catcher</h2>

      <p>
        I started from the default Blender scene and switched the renderer to <b>Cycles</b>.
        I removed the default point light and replaced it with a <b>360° HDR panoramic image</b>
        used as environment lighting.
      </p>

      <p>
        A large planar quad was added below the objects and set as a <b>shadow catcher</b>.
        This makes the plane invisible while still receiving shadows, allowing the synthetic objects
        to blend naturally into the photographed environment.

      <h2>Exercise 1 — Mirror materials</h2>

      <p>
        I added a sphere next to the cube and assigned both objects a <b>Principled BSDF</b>
        configured to behave like a perfect mirror.
      </p>

      <p>
        This was achieved by setting the <b>metallic value to 1</b> and the <b>roughness to 0</b>.
        The HDR environment is clearly reflected on both objects, demonstrating how environment lighting
        drives reflections in a physically based renderer.

    <!-- Exercise 2 -->
    <section class="exercise">
      <h2>Exercise 2 — Metallic and glass materials</h2>

      <p>
        In this exercise, I modified the materials to produce more realistic appearances.
        The sphere was turned into a <b>metallic glossy object</b> with a colored base and non-zero roughness,
        while the cube was changed into a <b>glass material</b>.
      </p>

      <p>
        The glass cube uses the Principled BSDF with <b>transmission enabled</b> and an
        <b>index of refraction (IOR) set to 1.5</b>.
        This produces realistic refraction and reflection effects consistent with physical optics.
      </p>

    <!-- Exercise 3 -->
    <section class="exercise">
      <h2>Exercise 3 — Imported mesh and final scene</h2>

      <p>
        I imported a triangle mesh into the scene and composed a final environment combining multiple objects.
        Materials were chosen to match the environment lighting and to enhance realism.
      </p>

      <p>
        To obtain a clean result, I adjusted several Cycles rendering parameters, such as
        <b>maximum light bounces</b>, <b>samples per pixel</b>, and enabled <b>multiple importance sampling</b>
        for the HDR environment.
      </p>

      <p>
        These parameters are crucial to balance render quality and noise, especially in scenes with
        glass, glossy reflections, and indirect illumination.

    <!-- Exercise 4 -->
    <section class="exercise">
      <h2>Exercise 4 — Cycles vs WebGPU</h2>

      <p>
        Using a third-party renderer like <b>Cycles</b> allows very fast production of high-quality images.
        Complex features such as global illumination, multiple importance sampling, caustics, and
        physically based materials are readily available and robust.
      </p>

      <p>
        However, Cycles offers limited control over the internal rendering algorithms.
        In contrast, a customizable renderer like <b>WebGPU</b> gives full control over ray generation,
        intersection logic, shading models, and sampling strategies.
        This makes WebGPU ideal for experimentation and learning.
      </p>

      <p>
        On the other hand, implementing features such as a full Principled BSDF,
        efficient path tracing, denoising, or HDR importance sampling would be a significant challenge
        to reproduce from scratch in WebGPU.
